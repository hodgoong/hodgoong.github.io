**Grasshopper's RESTful interfacing tool for Google Firebase**

- Development: Hojoong Chung

- Year: 2018 
- Programming Language: C#

After flux.io announced they are no longer supporting their users and the service will be shutting down on March 31st, 2018, I thought 'hmm, maybe I can provide something similar but simple that can be implemented quickly to serve people's urgent needs'. 

After spending two consecutive weekends, developing the first working MVP on the first weekend and adding more functionalities on the second week, the firehopper was launched on April 2nd, 2018.

The firehopper provides simple components for Grasshopper to get connected to Google's Firebase. The plug-in includes basic components like 'GET', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'POST', 'DELETE', and 'Key-value pair generator' to support HTTP communication and meta-data sharing.
