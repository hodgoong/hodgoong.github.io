# ITECH Pavilion(ICD-ITKE Research Pavilion) 2015-16
"A research pavilion purely built by masters sutdents using modern design computation and robotic fabrication technologies"

## Summary
- **Site Address:** Keplerstraße 11, 70174 Stuttgart, Germany
- **Site Area:** 85.0 m²
- **Project Duration:** OCT 2014 - APR 2016 (18 months including research, design, production, assembly, and vacation)
- **This project was awarded by ArchDaily for "*Building of the Year 2017*"**

## Description
"The pavilion consists of 151 segments that were prefabricated by robotic sewing. Each of them is made out of three individually laminated beech plywood strips. Ranging between 0.5 and 1.5 m in diameter, their specific shapes and material make-up are programmed to fit local structural and geometrical requirements. The textile connections developed for this project allow overcoming the need for any metal fasteners. The entire structure weighs 780 Kg while covering an area of 85 m2 and spanning 9.3 meters. With a resulting material thickness / span ratio of 1/1000 on average, the building has a structural weight of only 7.85 Kg/m2. [Ref: ArchDaily][1]"
