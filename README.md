# Content Management System based on MD files

This project started to build a container for my personal works. It had two main criterias when designing the product:

2. The contents should be created/stored file based

With this reason, this tool utilizes Markdown as a content source and be able to distribute the contents in real-time based on github's webpage hosting feature. To see how it looks like, please follow the link below:
